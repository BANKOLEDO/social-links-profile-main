## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media Queries


### What I Learned

1. **CSS Flexbox and Grid**: 
    - Utilized Flexbox to create a responsive layout, centering elements both horizontally and vertically within the viewport.
    - Applied Flexbox properties to align and distribute space within the card container.

2. **Responsive Design**:
    - Implemented media queries to adjust the layout and sizing of elements for different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.

3. **CSS Variables**:
    - Leveraged CSS variables for managing color schemes, making it easier to maintain and update the design.

4. **Typography and Spacing**:
    - Imported Google Fonts to enhance the visual appeal of the text.
    - Paid attention to margin, padding, and font sizing to create a visually balanced design.

5. **Hover Effects**:
    - Added hover effects to interactive elements (links and list items) to enhance user interaction and feedback.

6. **Semantic HTML**:
    - Used semantic HTML tags to improve the structure and readability of the code, which is beneficial for accessibility and SEO.

### Continued Development

1. **Advanced CSS Techniques**:
    - Explore CSS animations and transitions to add more dynamic interactions to the profile card.
    - Experiment with CSS Grid for more complex layouts and compare it with Flexbox to understand their strengths and use cases.


2. **Accessibility Improvements**:
    - Ensure the design is fully accessible by adding appropriate ARIA labels and roles.
    - Test the profile card with screen readers and make necessary adjustments to improve accessibility.

3. **Performance Optimization**:
    - Optimize images and other assets to improve the loading speed of the profile card.
    - Implement best practices for CSS and HTML to enhance performance and reduce page load time.

4. **Advanced Responsive Design**:
    - Learn and apply advanced responsive design techniques, such as responsive typography and container queries.
    - Explore modern CSS layout techniques like CSS Subgrid for more refined control over grid layouts.
